# Collections Practice

### Skills: iteration, arrays, dictionaries

## Instructions

The goal of this lab is to become proficient manipulating the basic data structures we use in iOS, arrays and dictionaries.  Try experimenting with the built in iOS `Array` and `Dictionary` methods as well as implementing your own logic to solve these.  

Write methods that solve each of the unit tests.

**Write your methods in the `collections.swift` file**
